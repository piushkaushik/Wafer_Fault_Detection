## Problem Statement:
The challenge at hand involves leveraging data collected from diverse sensors across multiple wafers used in electronic manufacturing. A wafer, essentially a thin semiconductor slice, serves as a crucial component in the production of integrated circuits. The objective is to construct a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the operational status of a given wafer, discerning whether replacement is necessary. The provided dataset comprises inputs from various sensors, and the binary classification task involves assigning one of two classes: +1, indicating that the wafer is in optimal working condition and does not require replacement; or -1, signifying a faulty wafer that necessitates replacement. The overarching goal is to develop a predictive model that enhances the efficiency of quality control in semiconductor manufacturing processes.

## Dataset:
For each wafer in consideration, data is sourced from an array of 500+ sensors. Subsequently, an evaluation is conducted to determine the operational status of the wafer, assigning it a classification of either +1 (indicating optimal functionality) or -1 (indicating a faulty condition).
